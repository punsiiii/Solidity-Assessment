# Solidity Assessment
This Solidity Assessment is a "Token" program that demonstrates the creating a token, minting, and burning of the made token using the Solidity programming language.

## Description
This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a language made for developing smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain. This program has functions that will create, mint, and burn a "Token". This serves as an assessment for the course of ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course, and can be used as a stepping stone for making more complex tokens in the future.

## Getting Started
Install to use the MyToken contract, GitHub users can either deploy it on their local development environment or on a public Ethereum network.

1. Download: Download the contract code here.
2. Modifications: Developers can modify the contract files and code as they see fit.

## Executing Program
Follow the steps below to deploy and test the MyToken Contract:

1. Compile and deploy the contract in a Ethereum network with the developer's choice using tools like Remix, Hardhat, etc.
2. Once compiled and deployed, the developer/user can interact with the contract using Ethereum wallet applications.
